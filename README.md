In this example a user can have many events as an event owner. An event has geolocation
information (latitude and longitude), which allows us to plot it on a map. A
user has and belongs to many events through attendances. A user can have only
one attendance per event.
The application does not ask for a username or password. Instead, we will
use an ID unique to the device ('device token') to track unique users.
